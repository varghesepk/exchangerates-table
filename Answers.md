## Questions and Answers 

### Did you have time to complete the coding test? What would you add if you had more time?

Basic structure of exchange rates table with minimal UI has been created with React latest version. If I had more time I can add some more features like exchange calculator, each currency rate detail page/modal, also I can add SASS (CSS preprocessor), some nice UI material libraries. And also I can create more reusable components which can be used for the future to make the app scalable.

### What was the most useful feature in your opinion that REACT provides? Please, include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.

JSX - JavaScript Centric HTML.
```javascript
<div classNames={condition ? 'true-class' : 'false-class'}>
    <input />
    <Component data={data} />
</div>
```

### In your opinion, what are the major differences between Angular, REACT and VueJS apps?

Angular is framework which includes all MVC packages with that. Vue is also have all the packages to work as framwework. React is a js library which help to create more on UI or View part. React Virtual Dom feature is gives you more advatages compare to other libraries.

### What's your favourite programming language? Why?

My favourite programming language is JavaScript. In JS, we can program around any methodology like - Functional or OOP. It is an isomorphic language - we can write server side as well as front end code in JS. We can create native mobile apps in JavaScript using some JS libraries.

When I strated this project very new to the tech stack what i used to build this web application in short span of time. It built on React, Redux, Firebase, CSS modules.
